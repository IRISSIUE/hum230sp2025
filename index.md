title: Frederick Douglass Digital Edition

# The homepage template includes title, banner image, and short description.
# Edit these in `_config.yml`, not in this file.
#
# OPTIONS FOR PAGE TITLE
# A. To have your edition title appear above your site description, fill in
#    the "title:" above.
# B. To hide it, leave "title:" blank.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HEADINGS
# The home page template, home.html, accounts for accessibility standards by
# creating a page title (a Heading 1) from the site title and hiding it from
# view, so that it is available to screen readers and assistive technologies
# even when it is not displayed on the page.
#
# Thus, DO NOT include a Heading 1 in the Markdown in the body of this file,
# since there should only be one Heading 1 per page in order to meet
# accessibility standards. If you include headings to the body of the page,
# start with Heading 2.

## Digital Editions

Although we often think of corrections to a text when we imagine editing, literary editions serve lots of functions (and very rarely is correction one of them!). Literary editions layer different kinds of information about a text through annotations, including background on the period or place, context from the author’s life and other works, and variants across different editions of the text. In this way, they help to make the text more approachable and help the reader engage with the text more deeply.

In a printed edition, you’ll often encounter these annotations as footnotes. In digital form, they come in lots of shapes and sizes: links to other pages, pop-ups, and digital footnotes that link back and forth between text and annotation.

Today, we’re using the Recovery Hub Digital Edition Template to annotate Frederick Douglass’s speech on the Dred Scott decision. You read this speech last week and made note of areas where further clarification and background might help people understand the text better. Today, we’ll put that into action.

The Recovery Hub’s template is designed to make the process of creating a digital edition simpler. Although there’s lots of code involved, you don’t have to write it! Instead, you can use their existing code and lightly customize it to suit your text. Today, you don’t have to interact with the code at all! But if you’re interested — maybe you want to try your hand at digitizing your family’s recipes, like we talked about last week? — you can find the template on GitHub.

## Frederick Douglass and the Dred Scott DECISION

One of our goals in this course is to use digital tools to interrogate our local community. Today, we're looking at Frederick Douglass's speech on the Dred Scott decision, the result of a case heard in St. Louis and very much wrapped up in the Missouri-Illinois border region that we occupy today. The decision denied emancipation to Dred and Harriet Scott, an enslaved husband and wife who had been relocated for several years to Illinois and Wisconsin before being brought back to Missouri, on the basis that the Constitution denied citizenship to African Americans and that the Scotts had no standing in court. It rightfully sparked national outcry. In this speech, Douglass (a noted Black orator, writer, and public intellectual) decried the decision.
